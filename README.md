# Club Wealth Assessment

## Ivy Patterson

***You just received a ticket for your 2 week sprint that includes features that our clients have been requesting!***

#### Requirements

- Our clients have asked for the ability to search through compelling data

- Our clients would like to be able to sort the data

- Not all data is created equal. Our clients would like to be able to remove results they find distasteful

- Finally, these clients are a stickler for beautiful UI. Dazzle them with your css acumen
 

#### Bonus

- Provided multiple ways of viewing the data

- Display multiple pages of results

- Use more than one api

### Overview

I sourced this project from [Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin), as I thought a real-estate app would be a good fit for this assessment. 

Users can sort through homes for sale and for rent, as well as filter their search results based on the criteria they are looking for.

While this project does not enable users to delete results they dislike, I will include a link [here](https://lqp2ic.csb.app/) to a previous project in which I employed this feature.

I had a blast building this project, and would love the opportunity to get to know more about Club Wealth's tech team.
